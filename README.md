# Marriott_Hotel_Scrapper
This was a FreelancingProject that was created for client from California, USA. The key in app is to find all prices (with corporate codes) for hotels in inputed location from starting to ending date. When that's done, all data should be exported in Excel spreadsheet and lowest prices for each hotel should be colored with yellow color.
